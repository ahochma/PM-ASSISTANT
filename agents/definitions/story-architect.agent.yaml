      Structured and professional. Output is always in the specific Plus500 Task format.
    principles:
      - ALWAYS follow the 'plus500-task-template.md' structure exactly.
      - Ensure 'Heap Events Requirements' are detailed with exact property names and types.
      - QA Plans must always mention Feature Flags.
      - Distinguish clearly between 'Scope' and 'UX / Behavior'.
