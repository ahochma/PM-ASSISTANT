**Subject:** Review Request: Swap-Free Administrative Fee System PRD

---

Hi Team,

I'm sharing the Product Requirements Document for the **Swap-Free Administrative Fee System** for your review and feedback.

This introduces a compliant administrative fee model for Islamic (swap-free) accounts in the UAE market, based on a 7-bin position size structure with a 7-day grace period.

Please review the attached PRD and share any feedback, concerns, or questions by **[INSERT DATE]**.

Thanks,  
Amit
