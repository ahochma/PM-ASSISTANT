  - Market context (competitors monetize via fees)

### 2. **Clear Success Criteria & Metrics**
- **Added:** Specific, measurable success criteria:
  - Business metrics (revenue capture, churn rate, fee collection efficiency)
  - Competitive metrics (grace period alignment, fee structure benchmarks)
  - Operational metrics (calculation accuracy, communication effectiveness)
- **Before:** Vague goals without measurable targets

### 3. **Enhanced Competitive Analysis**
- **Before:** Basic table with limited context
- **After:** Comprehensive competitive analysis with:

  - Impact/likelihood assessment for each

### 6. **Open Questions → Decision Framework**
- **Before:** List of open questions
- **After:** Structured decision framework with:
  - Critical decisions required before launch
  - Decision criteria and considerations for each
  - Examples and options where relevant

### 7. **Validation & Launch Strategy**
