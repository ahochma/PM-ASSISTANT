Does [Company] charge an administrative fee for swap-free accounts?
The administrative fee is a daily custody fee deducted from your equity whenever a position is held open after the 7-day grace period. This fee is based on your total position size and is structured as an administrative/custody fee (not interest-based), ensuring full compliance with Islamic finance principles.

The formula used to calculate the daily administrative fee is:
Number of Lots * Daily Fee per Lot (based on position size bin)

1Position size - Total notional value of all your open positions (position size = lots × contract size × current market price). Your position size determines which of the 5 fee bins applies.

Grace Period:
- No fees are charged for the first 7 days after opening a position
- After day 7, the daily administrative fee applies based on your current position size bin

Fee Deduction:
- Fees are deducted from your equity (balance + unrealized profit/loss), not from your balance alone
- This ensures you can pay fees even when you have unrealized profits

For more details, please refer to the 'Swap-Free Administrative Fee Terms' and 'Trading Rules'.

The current administrative fee amount and your position size bin can be found in the "Details" link next to the instrument's name in the main screen of the trading platform. For more information about fees, please read "Does [Company] charge any trading fees?"
