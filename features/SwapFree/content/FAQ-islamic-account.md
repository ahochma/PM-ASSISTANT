What is an Islamic (Swap-Free) account?
An Islamic account, also known as a swap-free account, is a trading account designed to comply with Islamic finance principles. Unlike standard accounts that charge overnight interest (swap fees), Islamic accounts do not charge interest-based fees, as Islamic finance principles prohibit riba (interest).

Key Features:
- No overnight interest charges (swap-free trading)
- Administrative fees instead of interest-based fees (after 7-day grace period)
- Full compliance with Sharia principles and UAE regulatory requirements (DFSA, SCA)
- Same trading capabilities as standard accounts

How it differs from standard accounts:
- Standard accounts: Charge overnight funding fees (interest-based swaps) when positions are held overnight
- Islamic accounts: Charge administrative/custody fees (not interest-based) after a 7-day grace period, ensuring compliance with Islamic finance principles

Administrative Fee Structure:
- 7-day grace period: No fees charged for the first 7 days after opening a position
- After grace period: Daily administrative fee based on your total position size (5-bin structure)
- Fee type: Administrative/custody fee (not interest), deducted from equity

1Administrative fees - These are service fees for maintaining open positions, structured as administrative or custody fees rather than interest-based charges, ensuring full Sharia compliance.
