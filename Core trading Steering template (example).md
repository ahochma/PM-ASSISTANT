## Executive summary

Several key initiatives are currently in progress across the platform. We are working on unifying the options infrastructure so weekly and monthly options run on the same backend. This will improve scalability and reduce maintenance effort.

In parallel, we are advancing 24/5 U.S. stock trading to extend trading availability for customers. On the execution side, we are launching the Fast Trading bottom sheet on iOS in experiment mode to improve order placement flow.

On the monetization side, the new Swap Free model for Islamic accounts is under implementation. In addition, we are continuing with UX improvements, with the Info tab UI uplift on web, while also addressing specific market needs such as margin overrides and instrument group adjustments.
